# Russian-Ebooks
A growing collection of full-text Russian ebooks, sorted by author, made available for reading, text analysis, and other scholarly and digital humanities work. New materials are regularly being added.

The English translations of these books were taken from Project Gutenberg, and are here made available in a centralized, text-only format. The Russian texts are from lib.ru. All of the works, both originals and translations, are in the public domain.
